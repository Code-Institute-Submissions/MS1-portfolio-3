# MS1 - Bradley Cooney Portfolio Website

This website has been created to demonstrate to recruiters and potential employers my key skills and experience in Full-Stack Web Development as the site owner.

## UX Design

The UX of this site has been designed with user ease and simplicity in mind. As a portfolio website designed to demonstrate the key skills of the site owner, it is important that end-users are not overwhelmed with too many options and paths to collect the information they are on the site to gather, as this may frustrate users and cause them to abandon the site.

### User Story - Recruiter

As a recruiter, I want to quickly find out information about the site owner, and understand whether they have the key capabilities determined by my client's requirements, making them suitable for the role. I am a less technical user, and therefore it's important that I can compare the skills listed with the brief provided to me by my client. Any advanced technical language or lack of clarity in expertise is likely to deter me from this site as I have many other sites to view in a short period of time. I want to very quickly make a decision on whether the site owner is suitable for the role.

<!--The first end user type for this website will be recruiters who are looking for developers on behalf of their clients. As a less technical user, their primary objective when visiting the site, is to understand whether the site owner is a suitable candidate for a client's role, based on the criteria set out.

This user is likely to view many sites similar to this one, and therefore is likely to spend as little time as necessary to understand the site owners capabilities. To ensure that this user can meet their objectives quickly before they move on to other sites, this site needs to help the user navigate the key areas as quickly and efficiently as possible.-->

### User story - technical hiring manager  
Like recruiters, I want to be able to quickly understand whether the site owner has the capabilities to join our organisation in the technical role we are hiring for. Whilst I also lack the time to read everything on the website, I have more of an understanding in technical language used, and whilst I cannot read everything, I would be looking to understand to what level the site owner can perform the skills shown to see how that would suit the role and compliment the other skills within the organisation. If the site owner's skills are of interest, then I want to be able to easily contact them without a lengthy form.

### User story - The site owner
As site owner, I want to be able to promote my key skills and experience to potential employers and those users who are in need of a Full-stack Developer. I want end-users of the site to be able to quickly, but accurately, make a decision on my suitability for their organisation. I also want users to contact me before they leave the site to ensure I do not miss out on potential work opportunities.


<!--
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.
-->

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features

- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
  - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
   1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
   2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
   3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
   4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
